to do:

Check for nullpointer/types for all of these!
Check for enough elements in the stack!

!import (and therefore, scripting support)

-->$stackname // copy top of current stack to $stackname
<--$stackname // copy top of $stackname to current stack
->$stackname  // move top of current stack to $stackname
<-$stackname  // move top of $stackname to current stack

commandline - script mode, switches, version, etc.

actors/concurrency?
