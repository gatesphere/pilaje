to do:

User input

Expression replacement in macros: something like &0 would mean "the value at top of the stack"
such that

    :move pop #(->$___temp) foreach $___temp #(->&0) foreach &0 
    1 2 3 "$new" move

would assign "$new" to &0, replace all copies of &0 in the macro with $new,
and then pop the top bit of information, and move to a new stack, preserving
order... $main = []<=, and $new = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]<=
&x would have no meaning outside of macros.

concurrency
  - coros (use a yield model, akin to Io)
  - futures (push an anonmacro to a stack, call stack as if it was a 
             macro, return immediately, block for completion at next access)

documentation (mostly yank from pila)
